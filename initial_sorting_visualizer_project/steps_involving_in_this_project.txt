1) firstly i made a simple skeleton of my project which i have implemented in sorting_visualizer.txt file
2) i learned html,css and javascript 4-5 months back so i kind of forget everything so i watched html in one video,css in one video and js in 
   one video from code with harry youtube channel channel just to remind 
3) well i didn't go through the whole videos but just grab imp things by skiping some part:)
4) then i experimented by myself of html,css and js just to get the feel
5) i had implemented sorting algorithms many times so i didn't need to remind them
6) finally after several attempts i had done html and css work excluding main animation part and it feels really good and created a basic html 
   page for my project.
7) finally i start writing js code
8) firstly i will relate some functionaly with speed and length selector with their text boxes also algo selection element with upper heading
9) now i am writing a function startsorting which will get array from inserted array in required form and which algo to use selected by user
 and will control the animation part 
10) now i have array stored in a variable ,speed,its length and algo type stored in variable
11) now first i will write all sorting algorithms which will take array as input and then sort them 
12 i created all sorting functions  
13) now i am watching video on how to control graphics using javascript and obvio in one video:)
14) things starts to getting messy i am facing one problem :(
15) added lines where you can set zoom as well
16) now only thing is i need to find to way to show swap animation of two lines
17) writing swap animation function is little bit tricky
18) i am stopping here as i have exam tommorow so i will continue from here from tommorow
19) at first i draw every rectangle using coordinates but there i was facing problem how to show the swaping animation os two rectangles
   so i decided that i will create a div block for every single rectangle and then it will be easy to manage that swaping animation
20) i observed during zoom in rectengles are overwriting on other elements so now i corrected by limiting their area on screen
21) i succeded in adding those div elements and it felt good:) next task is to animate in swapping
22) now all set only animation are taking place at one time after full array sorted but i need to find to way to show every transition 
   which is my next task except that function involving swap are working properly ans display on screen is also getting sorted by applying sorted 
   function
23) my today's exam is over and it went well:) and now i am resuming my work 
24) now i am picking color for various states
25) after tons of experimenting and searching on internet i finally found something effective regarding swaping animation
26) i am not getting any effective thing about it so a new idea came to my mind i will sort the array and will display the transition later
27) so i decided i will be storing every transition in a cache and then with the help of set interval javascript function i will show animation
28) i achieved something finaly i was able able to change color of rectangle by generated cache
29) finally i did it my display for bubble sort is working fine if array sorted in decreasing order now i need to manage whrere array is not sorted in decreasing order
30) now i will try something new i will be writing recursive function of bubble sort and will completely sort and display the array with this function only
31) man js is fun ac in one go i mean recursive code worked in one go 
32) and now i am writing recursive code for selection sort
33) selection sort done :) plus i got the feel of this project now code of rest algorithms will be easier
34) finally insertion sort done it was bit hard to implement for me
35) now two quicksort and mergesort hard algos left which i will do later now i need to go out with my friends
36) now insertion sort is working awesome now i will implement quicksort
37) these two are tricky i really need to think about them carefully how to implement their display version which is understable by seing
38) i am getting frustated so i will continue tommorow morning and once quicksort done then mergesort will be easy
39) i am very close to a perfect quicksort function and i have learned a lot by implementing this function
40) here the point is when you finish one recursive call completely with animation only then you should call next recursive but that is creating a 
   preoblem here because i need to make two recursive calls here instea of one  and i am trying to solve this problem right now other than
    that everything has been implemented for this function
41) i will store every recursive call in an object as its property and when i make a call from this obj i will delete this recursive call property from object
42) now things are getting really messy everything is working fine except one and i was not able to find that bug but i will carry on my search
43) man!! sometimes small mistakes lead to hours of brainstorming its just i had used l1 instead of l2 somewhere
44) i am extremely happy quicksort done perfectly now i am asuming mergesort will hardly take 1hr to code may be more because i am thinking
   to animate mergesort a little differently which is more complicated than quicksort
45) it definitely will take more than 1 hr as i am thingking to introduce a completely seprate small window which will help mergesort to display
46) but first i will have dinner and then play cod for 30 min then i will start implementing this
47) this one(merge sort) is the hardest to implement i got frustated so i will continue my work from tommorow morning
48) well merge sort is going to be very complicated for me
49) man!! merge sort done so easily :) i thought it would be hard to implement and i messed up little with colors but that can be corrected very
easily 
50) hurrah!! i have completed this project within 3 days!!
51) believe me this feels so good 800+ lines of js , 150+ lines of css and 80+ lines of html it was fun


now that i have done this project i will be again writing this project but this time i know what mistakes i have made and how much complications
i have created so i will writing my whole code again with proper naming conventions and seperate js files for different sorting algoeithms
because in this code i write really big functions which i thing i can reduce now as now i have better understanding

i finally rewrite the whole code which very less complected and very short and best thing is i only took one day to code now its 2 A.M. but
man first time it feels so good to see my work i hope you will like it
