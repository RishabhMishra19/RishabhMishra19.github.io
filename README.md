this is a project for visualizing sorting algorithms

i have written down the steps as well as the challenges i have faced in making this project along with that inthe first i made this project but this got messed up that 
time although that was working well but i complicated the things as i had no previous experience in javascript but after making the whole project that many things in 
this project can be done very easily in a simple manner thats why i re write the whole code and this time i had reduced and simplified my code drastically so i am
prving the file in which i have written down steps and challenges in this project and my initial project and final one you can see which i hosted on github
thankyou it will somehow help others

ps - js is fun!! :)
